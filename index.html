            <p>A lot of software developers like to make things complicated.
                <br> They get something that could be simple and easy and, due to what <br> most people tell on the internet, make it complicated. <br> Software should be simple.</p>

                <p>Many people ask me how I can become an expert level programmer.<br> We still don't have a unified model for this, but I still want to<br> share some of my experience with you. How to become an expert-level<br> programmer depends to a large
                    extent on the software you develop,<br> the industry you are in, and the tools used by your company.</p>
